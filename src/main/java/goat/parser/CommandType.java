/**
 * The set of instructions Goat understands.
 *
 * Each constant pairs the name used internally with the keyword the user
 * actually types. Keeping them in an enum means a command can only be
 * referred to by a name the compiler knows: a mistyped "case LSIT" fails
 * to build, whereas a mistyped string literal would compile and simply
 * never match at runtime.
 *
 * The name says "type" rather than just "Command" because a constant here
 * only identifies <em>which</em> command was typed; it holds none of the
 * work of carrying that command out.
 *
 * The enum is package-private. Every use of it is inside {@link Parser}, and
 * all of them are in private methods -- the keyword a user typed is a detail
 * of how a line gets read, and no other package has any business knowing that
 * this enum is how the reading is done.
