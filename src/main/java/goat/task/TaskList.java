/**
 * Holds the tasks Goat is keeping track of, and the operations that change them.
 *
 * Before this class existed, {@link goat.Goat} passed a bare {@code ArrayList<Task>}
 * to every helper method. That worked, but it left the list itself with no
 * behavior of its own: anything holding the list could do anything to it, and
 * "the rules about the task list" were spread across whoever happened to be
 * handling the current command.
 *
 * Wrapping the list gives those rules one home. In particular, the translation
 * from the number the user types (counting from 1) to the index the list uses
 * (counting from 0), and the check that the number refers to a task that really
 * exists, now happen here in {@link #get(int)} and {@link #delete(int)} rather
 * than being repeated by each caller.
 *
 * The wrapped list is kept private and is never handed out, so a task can only
 * be added or removed through the methods below.
